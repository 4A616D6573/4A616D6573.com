I'm a security analyst for a multinational IT service provider. This site might be used for musings on the industry and sharing my own personal education in the way of technical writes ups.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/4A616D6573).

You can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/4A616D6573).

This site is generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes.

It's an immensely useful tool. Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).

This site is built on Poole. It's designed and developed by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo) to provide a clear and concise foundational setup for any Jekyll site.

This site is also slightly modified to have an 'About', 'Archive' and 'Feed' with the help of [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole).
