Why? What is this for?

To quote Cave Johnson from Valves [Portal 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/).

"Science isn't about why, it's about why not!"

I spend a good part of my work day reading other peoples security blogs. I gain a huge amount of knowledge through doing so. I figure why can't I can contribute and help others learn as well?

Every once in a while I could come up with something decent.

I gained inspiration from [www.malware-traffic-analysis.net](http://malware-traffic-analysis.net/) by ["Brad Duncan"](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic).

Malware Traffic Analysis provides great write ups on malware campaigns. This site helped me understand [EI Test](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2014/10/exposing-the-flash-eitest-malware-campaign/) and [Rig-EK](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/exploits/2016/09/rig-exploit-kit-takes-on-large-malvertising-campaign/) which was very useful at the time I came across it.

Since that day I have had Malware Traffic Analysis as part of my daily news digest. It continues to provide great information on current trends.

My goal for this site is the attempt Malware Traffic Analysis investigations. I will also throw up some other posts when I come across anything interesting.

I aim to publish at least one post a ~~week~~ fortnight but that might vary depending on how busy I am :).
