Why? What is this for?

To quote Cave Johnson from Valves [Portal 2](http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/).

"Science isn't about why, it's about why not!"

Why not do this?

Well, I spend a good part of my work day reading other peoples security blogs and I gain a huge amount of knowledge through doing so. I figured why can't I can contribute and help others learn as well?

Maybe every once in a while I'll come up with something decent.

I originally gained inspiration from [www.malware-traffic-analysis.net](www.malware-traffic-analysis.net) which is written by the elusive ["Brad"](https://twitter.com/malware_traffic).

Malware Traffic Analysis provides great write ups on malware campaigns that are generally distributed through email spam. This site helped me understand [EI Test](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2014/10/exposing-the-flash-eitest-malware-campaign/) and [Rig-EK](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/exploits/2016/09/rig-exploit-kit-takes-on-large-malvertising-campaign/) which was very useful at the time I came across it.

Since that day I have had Malware Traffic Analysis as part of my daily news digest and it continues to provide great information on current trends.

My goal for this site is the attempt Malware Traffic Analysis style investigations for my own personal education, I might also throw up some other posts when I think or come across anything interesting.

I aim to publish at least one post a week but that might vary depending on how busy I am :).
